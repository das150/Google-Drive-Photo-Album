# Upload Photos to a Google Drive Album

Code for a Google Drive photo album where any user can upload their photos/videos **USING YOUR STORAGE**.






## Set-up

Once you have loaded the code in Google Script, the first step is to create a main Google Drive folder where the photos will be stored. Next, replace the folder ID in server.gs.

Deploy the project as a web app so that anyone can execute it as you.

Copy the web app's URL, and then add the following to the end:

```bash
  # [Year]y34ieng[00 Month]mgjtjy34[Event name]
```

This is the part of the URL that defines where to upload the photos. You can change the year, month (in 01 January format), and event name for each of your events. Duplicate folders will not be created!
